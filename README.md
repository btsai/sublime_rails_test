## Toggle Rails Test File

Simple plugin and key binding (Cmd + .) to toggle between a Rails model / lib file or controller file and its related unit or functional test.

## Installation

Sorry, I'm not pushing these through PackageControl so just clone to your Library/Application Support/Sublime/Packages folder.
